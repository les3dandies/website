ABOUT THE FONT

'FRY'S ORNAMENTED' is a high quality font containing full hinting for 
correct rendering at small point sizes and a total of 97 kerning pairs for 
correct character spacing. It is supplied 'as is' and no warranty is implied 
or given by the author. 'FRY'S ORNAMENTED' is a display font and is not really
suited to body text. It is based on the work of Stephenson Blake and only
includes the characters which were defined by him. It is best used at 18 points
and above but will render down to 8 point without trouble. The font contains a
full range of upper case letters, the figures 0 to 9, and a limited range of
punctuation. There are no lower case characters, and no diacritics. It was
hand traced in order to achieve a high quality outline and compiled using
Type Designer 3.1. This font represents approximately 300 man-hours 
of work.

The latest version of this font is always available for download from the 
file list of the fonts conference on the Cix conferencing system. The author 
would appreciate notification of any problems experienced with this font 
together with any suggestions for improvements.
